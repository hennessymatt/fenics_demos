This folder contains several files associated with the mesh:

channel_sphere.geo - this is a script for Gmsh; it can be opened and edited with a text editor.  Inside this file are the parameters and instructions for creating the mesh

channel_sphere.msh - this file contains the mesh. It is created by running the command gmsh channel_sphere.geo -format msh2 -2 -o channel_sphere.msh

*.xml - these files have the same info as the .msh file but can be loaded into Fenics.  That is, Fenics requires .msh files to be converted into .xml files (note: I think it is possible to use a Python version of Gmsh to generate a mesh which can be used by Fenics without needing to save/export/import any files).  The .xml files can be created from the .msh file by running dolfin-convert channel_sphere.msh channel_sphere.xml
